    "##  第一章：死生边缘的托付 | Chapter 1: A Trust Born of Tragedy\n",
    "\n",
    "故事的开端笼罩在若尔盖草原的阴云下。格林的父亲死于人类的猎枪，母亲因绝望而吞下毒药殉情。当李微漪在狼洞中发现格林时，它是六只幼崽中唯一的幸存者，正闭着眼在同伴的尸体中索求一点余温。\n",
    "\n",
    "The story begins under the dark clouds of the Zöigê Prairie. Green’s father was killed by a hunter’s rifle, and his mother, consumed by despair, took her own life by eating poison. When Li Weiyi discovered Green in the wolf den, he was the sole survivor among six cubs, his eyes still closed, huddling against his siblings' cold bodies for a final trace of warmth.\n",
    "\n",
    "李微漪将这团微弱的生命揣进怀里，带回了成都。她用奶瓶喂养它，用体温守护它。在城市的公寓里，格林奇迹般地活了下来。它像小狗一样摇尾巴，却在听到电视里的狼嚎时，会不由自主地挺直脊背，发出一声稚嫩却苍凉的长啸。那是刻在骨子里的荒野基因，在钢筋水泥中痛苦地挣扎。\n",
    "\n",
    "Li Weiyi tucked this fragile life into her coat and brought him back to Chengdu. She bottle-fed him and guarded him with her own body heat. In a city apartment, Green miraculously survived. He would wag his tail like a puppy, yet whenever he heard a wolf’s howl on television, he would instinctively straighten his back and let out a high-pitched, desolate cry. It was the genetic memory of the wilderness, struggling painfully within the confines of steel and concrete.\n",

    "##  第二章：城市里的“荒野之魂” | Chapter 2: A Wild Soul in the City\n",
    "\n",
    "随着格林渐渐长大，它的本能开始与城市文明发生剧烈冲突。它会在半夜抓挠地板，渴望挖掘洞穴；它会在阳台上眺望远方，眼神中透着一种不属于宠物犬的深邃与孤独。\n",
    "\n",
    "As Green grew, his instincts began to clash violently with urban civilization. He would scratch at the floorboards at midnight, longing to dig a den; he would stand on the balcony staring into the distance, his eyes holding a depth and loneliness that never belonged to a pet dog.\n",
    "\n",
    "最让李微漪揪心的是，格林为了讨好她，甚至学会了像狗一样吠叫。那一刻，她感到了前所未有的恐惧：如果格林失去了狼的尊严，那它还剩下什么？她意识到，真正的爱不是占有，而是还它以自由。于是，她变卖了部分家产，毅然带着格林回到了那片让它家破人亡、却也属于它的草原。\n",
    "\n",
    "What broke Li Weiyi’s heart most was when Green, in an attempt to please her, learned to bark like a dog. At that moment, she felt an unprecedented fear: if Green lost the dignity of a wolf, what would be left of him? She realized that true love is not possession, but restoration of freedom. Thus, she sold her belongings and resolutely took Green back to the prairie—the land that had destroyed his family, yet the only place where he truly belonged.\n",

    "\n",
    "在海拔4000米的野化基地，李微漪把自己变成了一只“母狼”。她模仿狼的动作教格林捕猎，带它观察旱獭的习性。\n",
    "\n",
    "At a re-wilding base 4,000 meters above sea level, Li Weiyi transformed herself into a \"mother wolf.\" She mimicked wolf movements to teach Green how to hunt and guided him in observing the habits of marmots.\n",
    "\n",
    "**那件震撼人心的小事 (The Heart-Stopping Incident):**\n",
    "有一次，李微漪在山里扭伤了脚，又患上严重的高原反应，卧床不起。格林没有独自去玩耍，它在窗外守了一整夜。第二天，它竟然从几公里外衔回来一只藏在雪地里的野兔，放在她的窗台上。它甚至试图用头拱开门，把食物推到她面前。那一刻，它不是野兽，它是她的孩子，是她的守护者。\n",
    "\n",
    "Once, Li Weiyi sprained her ankle in the mountains and suffered severe altitude sickness, leaving her bedridden. Green did not go off to play; he guarded her outside the window all night. The next day, he actually trekked kilometers away to retrieve a wild rabbit hidden in the snow and placed it on her windowsill. He even tried to nudge the door open with his head to push the food toward her. In that moment, he was not a beast; he was her child, her protector.\n",

    "\n",
    "2011年的隆冬，格林终于遇到了真正的狼群。在那个极寒的夜晚，狼群的呼唤在山谷间回荡。格林站在山脊上，一边是它深爱的人类母亲，一边是它魂牵梦绕的族群。\n",
    "\n",
    "In the deep winter of 2011, Green finally encountered a real wolf pack. On that frigid night, the calls of the wolves echoed through the valley. Green stood on the ridge—on one side was the human mother he loved deeply, and on the other was the pack he had dreamed of joining.\n",
    "\n",
    "它回头望了李微漪三次。每一次回头，眼神都充满了撕心裂肺的不舍。李微漪忍着剧痛，对他大喊：“走吧！格林，走吧！”最终，格林发出一声长啸，纵身跃入黑暗，消失在茫茫雪原。\n",
    "\n",
    "He looked back at Li Weiyi three times. With each turn, his eyes were filled with a heart-wrenching reluctance. Swallowing her own agony, Li Weiyi shouted to him: \"Go! Green, go!\" Finally, Green let out a long howl, leaped into the darkness, and vanished into the boundless snow.\n",

    "Years later, they met again. Green was now an Alpha. He watched Li Weiyi from a distance with his mate and cubs but did not approach. The tenderness in his eyes remained, but he belonged entirely to the wild now. Li Weiyi said: \"I saved his life, but he saved my soul.\""
